IranBax Tunnel - High Performance & Stealth Tunneling
===================================================

This script provides two of the most effective methods for bridging Iran
and Kharej servers in 2024-2025.

Option 1: Hysteria2 (UDP / QUIC) - High Performance
--------------------------------------------------
- Best for: Extremely unstable networks and high packet loss.
- Protocol: Modified QUIC (UDP).
- Features: "Brutal" congestion control that forces throughput even when
  the ISP is trying to drop packets.
- Obfuscation: XOR-based password masking to look like random UDP traffic.

Option 2: Reality (TCP / TLS) - Ultimate Stealth
-----------------------------------------------
- Best for: When your Kharej IP is being carefully watched or UDP is restricted.
- Protocol: VLESS-Reality (TCP).
- Features: Indistinguishable from a real website (like Google or Microsoft).
- Security: It uses a real TLS certificate from a legitimate website of your
  choice. It doesn't have a "fingerprint" that GFW can detect.
- Resilience: Because it looks like standard HTTPS traffic to a famous site,
  it is the least likely to be blocked. If your IP is partially blocked,
  Reality has the best chance of staying under the radar.

Important Note on Blocked IPs:
-----------------------------
If your Kharej IP is completely blocked (nulled) by the GFW, direct
connections will not work regardless of the protocol. In such cases:
1. Try using an IPv6 address if available.
2. Use a relay server or a clean CDN IP.
3. Re-deploy the tunnel using a different port or a different SNI (website
   to masquerade as).

The IranBax Tunnel script automatically applies system-level optimizations
(BBR) to ensure both methods work at their peak potential.
