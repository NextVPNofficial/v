IranBax Tunnel - High Performance Stealth Tunnel
================================================

This tunnel is based on Hysteria2, a next-generation proxy/tunneling tool
specifically designed to overcome network environments with high packet loss
and aggressive filtering (like Iran's GFW).

Why Hysteria2?
--------------
1. QUIC-based: It uses the QUIC protocol (UDP), which is naturally more
   resistant to certain types of TCP-based filtering and "parazits" (interference).
2. Brutal Congestion Control: Unlike standard TCP or QUIC, Hysteria2 uses
   a custom "brutal" algorithm that can saturate your link even when
   there is 10-20% packet loss. This is perfect for unstable data center
   connections.
3. Obfuscation (obfs): Every packet is obfuscated with a password-based XOR
   mask, making it look like random UDP data. This bypasses Deep Packet
   Inspection (DPI) that looks for known protocol signatures (like Rathole,
   V2Ray, or standard TLS).
4. Masquerading: It can mimic a standard HTTPS (HTTP/3) connection.

How it works:
-------------
- Kharej Server: Acts as the Hysteria2 server. It listens on a UDP port
  of your choice.
- Iran Server: Acts as the Hysteria2 client. It establishes a persistent
  tunnel to the Kharej server and forwards any local ports you specify
  directly to the Kharej server over the encrypted QUIC stream.

This method is currently one of the most effective ways to bridge Iran and
Kharej servers because it doesn't rely on standard TCP handshakes which are
frequently disrupted.
